C++ Variables, Literals and Constants
C++ Variables
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). For example,
int age = 14;
Here, age is a variable of the int data type, and we have assigned an integer value 14 to it.

The int data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers. Similarly, we can use the double data type if we have to store decimals and exponentials.

Rules for naming a variable
A variable name can only have alphabets, numbers, and the underscore _.
A variable name cannot begin with a number.
It is a preferred practice to begin variable names with a lowercase character. For example, name is preferable to Name.
A variable name cannot be a keyword. For example, int is a keyword that is used to denote integers.
A variable name can start with an underscore. However, it's not considered a good practice.


C++ Fundamental Data Types
Data Type	Meaning			Size (in Bytes)
int	        Integer			2 or 4
float		Floating-point		4
double		Double Floating-point	8
char		Character		1
wchar_t		Wide Character		2
bool		Boolean			1
void		Empty			0


1. C++ int
The int keyword is used to indicate integers.
Its size is usually 4 bytes. Meaning, it can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
For example,
int salary = 85000;

2. C++ float and double
float and double are used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
The size of float is 4 bytes and the size of double is 8 bytes. Hence, double has two times the precision of float. To learn more, visit C++ float and double.
For example,
float area = 64.74;
double volume = 134.64534;
