In C++, a vector is a dynamic array-like data structure provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). It is part of the C++ Standard Library and is defined in the <vector> header. Vectors are used to store a collection of elements that can dynamically grow or shrink in size.

Key characteristics of vectors in C++:

Dynamic Sizing: Unlike static arrays, the size of a vector can change dynamically at runtime. You can add or remove elements from a vector without worrying about resizing it manually.

Contiguous Memory: Vectors store their elements in contiguous memory locations, making element access and iteration efficient.

Random Access: Vectors support random access, which means you can access elements by their index in constant time (O(1)).

Type-Safe: Vectors are type-safe, meaning they can only store elements of a specific data type. For example, if you declare a vector of integers, you can only store integers in it.

Automatic Memory Management: Vectors manage memory automatically. When elements are added or removed, memory is allocated or deallocated as needed.

Standard Library Functions: Vectors come with a wide range of member functions and algorithms from the STL, which makes working with them convenient and efficient. For example, you can use functions like push_back, pop_back, size, empty, begin, end, and more.


example:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Declare a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> myVector;

    // Add elements to the vector
    myVector.push_back(10);
    myVector.push_back(20);
    myVector.push_back(30);

    // Access elements using indexing
    std::cout << "Element at index 0: " << myVector[0] << std::endl;

    // Iterate through the vector
    for (int i = 0; i < myVector.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << "Element at index " << i << ": " << myVector[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
