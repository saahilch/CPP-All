base class can hold ref of child class
compile datatype:base class
run time data type :child


to call child class specific method
parent class object must be converted into child class
this is forcefully  downcasting
use typeid:to identify data type at runtime(execution)

and use dynamic_cast<> for converting base class object into derived class obj
